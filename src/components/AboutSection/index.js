            My name is Mariusz Niedzielski and currently I am looking for vacancy as a Junior Front Developer. I've
            graduated <strong>civil engineering</strong> on the University of Zielona Góra with
            Bachelor’s degree.<br /><br /><AboutHR /><br />But that was mistake. I've made decision about what I want to do in my life
            when I was frivolous teenager. My friend said to me 'Let's study civil engineering!' And I was like 'Why
            not... ;)'. At the beginning of 2023, I started thinking about a change in my professional life. I did some
            research online and purchased a website development course on <strong>Udemy</strong> platform. And it was a
            good shot!<br /><br /><AboutHR /><br />
            First, I studied after my regular job. After few months I realized it brings me a lot of fun and this is
            what I want to do full-time . In July I said 'ADIÓS!' to my boss and started focusing strictly on
            bettering my skills in web development. The simplicity, along with multiple new possibilities and functionalities which brings the <strong>ReactJS</strong> library, caused the fact that I bond my future as a programmer especially with this technology.<br /><br /><AboutHR /><br />
            I love seeing the visual effect of my work written in code. Minimalistic and neat design with the emphasis on the details, well-matched colors of the graphic design with dynamic functionalities is what I like the most in creating websites. I tried to make this particular site was made in this style - slick and simple.<br /><br /><AboutHR /><br />
